# Mobile Money USSD Dummy

Mobile Money USSD Dummy is a Python project that simulates the functionality of a mobile money USSD code. This project provides users with a menu-driven interface to navigate through various transactions within a mobile money system. It serves as a tool for learning and experimentation, allowing users to understand the mechanics of USSD codes and their role in mobile money services.

## Features

- Transaction Simulations: Users can perform simulated transactions such as money transfers, withdrawals, airtime and bundle purchases, and account management actions.
- Menu-Driven Interface: The project utilizes a menu system that prompts users for their desired actions and guides them through the available options.
- Expandable and Customizable: Developers can extend the functionality of this project by adding their own code to handle specific transaction types or integrate it with existing mobile money systems.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-money-ussd-dummy.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd mobile-money-ussd-dummy`
3. Run the script: `python ussd_dummy.py`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the menu and simulate various transactions.
5. Provide the USSD code `*111#` to access the mobile money USSD dummy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real mobile money APIs for live testing and development.
- Adding additional transaction types and functionality to provide a more comprehensive simulation.
- Implementing data persistence to store transaction records and user data.
- Enhancing the user interface and adding error handling for a more robust user experience.
